## âœ¨ **Complete Story Reading & Recall Test**

The Logical Memory Test has been **completely enhanced** to provide a proper story reading phase followed by hidden recall phases, exactly as requested!

## ðŸš€ **How the Enhanced Test Works**

### **Phase 1: Story Reading (5 minutes)**
```
User reads a detailed story â†’ Story is displayed clearly â†’ Timer shows reading time
```

**What Happens:**
- **Story Display**: Full story shown in a scrollable, easy-to-read format
- **Reading Time**: 5-minute timer for careful reading
- **Clear Instructions**: User knows they'll need to recall the story later
- **Visual Design**: Story presented in a clean, readable container

### **Phase 2: Immediate Recall (3 minutes)**
```
Story is hidden â†’ User recalls details â†’ Text input for detailed responses
```

**What Happens:**
- **Story Hidden**: Story completely removed from view
- **Recall Prompt**: Clear instructions to recall as many details as possible
- **Detailed Input**: Large text area for comprehensive recall
- **Time Limit**: 3 minutes for immediate recall

### **Phase 3: Delayed Recall (3 minutes)**
```
After delay â†’ User recalls story again â†’ Tests memory retention
```

**What Happens:**
- **Delayed Testing**: Tests memory consolidation over time
- **Same Format**: Large text area for detailed recall
- **Time Limit**: 3 minutes for delayed recall
- **Memory Assessment**: Evaluates both immediate and delayed memory
